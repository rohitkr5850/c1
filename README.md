# Movie Slideshow Web Application

This project is a simple, interactive web application that displays a slideshow of movie images. Users can add their own images dynamically, control the image transition speed, and navigate through the images using controls for previous, next, and pause. The project is implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with JavaScript handling asynchronous programming, DOM manipulation, and event handling.

## Features

- **Automatic Slideshow**: Displays a slideshow of predefined movie images, transitioning every 2 seconds.
- **Dynamic Image Addition**: Allows users to add new images by entering the image URL and specifying an optional position in the slideshow.
- **Navigation Controls**: Users can navigate through the images with "Previous," "Next," and "Pause" buttons.
- **Edge Case Handling**: Ensures that user-provided images are inserted correctly, and handles cases where the specified position is out of bounds.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML** for structure
- **CSS** for styling and layout
- **JavaScript** for slideshow logic, asynchronous programming, DOM manipulation, and event handling
